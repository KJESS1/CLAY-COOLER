# DeepBook V3 Integration Strategy

CLAY COOLER is designed to leverage Sui's native liquidity layer. 

### The Flow:
1. **Tip Received:** A supporter "Makes it Snow" by sending $SUI or $LOFI to a Creator Profile.
2. **On-Chain Storage:** The assets are held within the Creator's unique Profile Object.
3. **Internal Swap:** Using **DeepBook V3**, creators can execute swaps (e.g., converting $SUI tips into $LOFI) directly from their dashboard without needing an external DEX.

This ensures that "The Pulse" of the community stays within the ecosystem and provides immediate utility for tipped rewards.
